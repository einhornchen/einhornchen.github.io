<h1>Hi! Feel like going for a walk?</h1>
<p>

Hey! I don't know you, but I'd like to! I put together a little tour of my neighbourhood, the Mission District.
   I've only lived here for a year but I got to know it pretty damn well during my pandemic walks. I set up an
     auto-responding phone number that will guide you through 10+ of my favourite spots. Every message has a clue
     in it that you respond to with the answer to be given your next directions. They're really easy, I promise!!
</p>
  <p>
This tour is about 5km in length, it shouldn't take you more than an hour-ish to complete. It starts and ends at Dolores Park, on the corner of 18th and Dolores. 
  </p>
  <p>
Once you get to the end I will send you my (non-robotic) phone number and I'd love to buy you a beer/coffee/tea/donut as reward!
  </p>

Here is an example: <br>

    My SMS Message: <i> Welcome to Harry Potter's school of witchcraft and wizardry! Can you tell me the name? (H-------). </i> <br>
    Your SMS Response: <i> Hogwarts </i> <br>
    Next Message: <i> ...</i> <br>
<br>
    <b>
      Ready to go? Text “Ready!” to the number ---------- </b>
