    <h1>Hi! Feel like going for a walk?</h1>
    <p>

    Hey! I don't know you, but I'd like to! I put together a little tour of my neighbourhood, the Mission District.
     I've only lived here for a year but I got to know it pretty damn well during my pandemic walks. I set up an
         auto-responding phone number that will guide you through 10+ of my favourite spots. Every message has a clue
         in it that you respond to with the answer to be given your next directions. They're really easy, I promise!!
    </p>
      <p>
          This tour is about <strong> 5 km </strong> in length, it shouldn't take you more than an <strong> hour-ish </strong> to complete. It starts and ends at Dolores Park, on the corner of <strong> 18th and Dolores </strong>. 
      </p>
      <p><br>
      <small>
    Here is an example:
<ul>
    <li>
        My SMS Message: <i> Welcome to Harry Potter's school of witchcraft and wizardry! Can you tell me the name? (H-------). </i></li>
    <li>    Your SMS Response: <i> Hogwarts </i></li>
    <li>   Next Message: <i> Amazing!... </i></li>
          </ul>
          </small>
       </p><br>
      <p>
    Once you get to the end I will send you my (non-robotic) phone number and I'd love to buy you a beer/coffee/tea/donut as reward!
      </p>
   <p>Sound like fun? To get started...</p>
